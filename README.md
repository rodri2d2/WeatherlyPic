## Main goals for the v1.0

The main goal is to create an app to access the resources of public available APIs and manage those received data correctly by updating user interface correctly and administrating network calls.

### This app will implement:

- [X] URLSessions
- [X] CoreLocation
- [X] DispatchQueue
- [X] NIB file (for v1.0)
- [X] Openweathermap API
- [X] Unsplash API

## TODOS for v2.0

- [ ] Control day and night images
- [ ] Try to show City image on background
- [ ] Control climate images
- [ ] Add more weather info
- [ ] Review Queue control and code itself

```
 The free version of Openweathermap API uses HTTP request which is not allowed for production in iOS
```
