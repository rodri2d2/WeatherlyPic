# Weatherly Pic
A weather application that changes its background image based on weather condition

## Main goals for the v1.0

The main goal is to create an app to access the resources of public available APIs and manage those received data correctly by updating user interface correctly and administrating network calls.

### This app will implement:

- [X] URLSessions
- [ ] CoreLocation
- [X] DispatchQueue
- [ ] Gesture recognizer
- [X] NIB file (for v1.0)
- [X] Openweathermap API
- [ ] Unsplash API




```
 The free version of Openweathermap API uses HTTP request which is not allowed for production in iOS
```
